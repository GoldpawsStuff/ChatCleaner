Simple addon to clean up your chat, make it prettier and easier on the eye, without the need to spread it to multiple windows or disable a lot of chat message groups.

This addon doesn't really add or remove chat content, it simply restyles it to look better. You decide what you see based on your own selected chat message groups in any given chat window. The one exception is gold, which will always be intercepted and prettied up.

You can toggle active filters through the options menu accessible with `/chatcleaner`or `/cc`.

## Downloading & Installing
I recommend downloading the UI from either [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chat-cleaner) or [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/chatcleaner), or use their respective download clients which provides the same versions and installs them automatically for you. Be aware that only these download locations provide finished packaged addons with all libraries included.

If you choose to download and manually install directly from GitHub, you'll have to install the following libraries as standalones in order for the UI to work:
- [Ace3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ace3)
- [LibMoreEvents-1.0](https://curseforge.com/wow/addons/libmoreevents-1-0)
- [TaintLess](https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/taintless) (Not on CurseForge/Wago)
