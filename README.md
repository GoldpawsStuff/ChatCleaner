Simple addon to clean up your chat, make it prettier and easier on the eye, without the need to spread it to multiple windows or disable a lot of chat message groups.

This addon doesn't really add or remove chat content, it simply restyles it to look better. You decide what you see based on your own selected chat message groups in any given chat window. The one exception is gold, which will always be intercepted and prettied up.

You can toggle active filters through the options menu accessible with `/chatcleaner`or `/cc`.
